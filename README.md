TLDR: see [the tutorial](docs/tutorial/README.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to use the non-rigid ICP algorithm.

## Method

This is an implementation of the method described in the [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/22/5348) "**Non-rigid point cloud registration using piece-wise tricubic polynomials as transformation model**".

This method can be used to register two 3D point clouds which are related by a non-rigid transformation. In other words, when a 6 degree-of-freedom rigid-body transformation (3 translation + 3 rotations) is insufficient to align the two point clouds, this method might be a suitable alternative.

## Examples

The following shows the non-rigid registration of two mobile mapping LiDAR point clouds in an urban environment:

![Non-rigid registration of two mobile mapping LiDAR point clouds (city)](docs/demo-city.gif)
(The effect of registration can best be seen on the overhead lines)

The method is quite flexible. In this example, it was used to estimate a treeâ€™s motion field between sunset (red) and sunrise (green):

Another example is the non-rigid registration of two mobile mapping LiDAR point clouds of a railway track (full video [here](https://youtu.be/HtRZxoqb4tc)):

## Executables

Two command line executables are provided:
- `nonrigid-icp`: Estimates the non-rigid transformation between two point clouds
- `nonrigid-icp-transform`: Applies the estimated non-rigid transformation to a point cloud

Builds are provided for Linux and Windows, see [Releases](https://github.com/AIT-Assistive-Autonomous-Systems/3D_nonrigid_ICP/releases).

These are the help messages of the two executables:

**nonrigid-icp --help**:

                                "f,fx/fy/fz,fxy/fxz/fyz,fxyz" (default:

## Build

### Building on Linux

A ready-to-use development environment for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is available in the [.devcontainer/](.devcontainer/) folder. To get started, clone this repository (use LFS if you plan to run the tests), open it in VSCode, and follow these steps:
1. Open the devcontainer with the command ``Dev Containers: Reopen in Container``. This will automatically build the development environment and open it. Then run in the container:
    1. The command ``CMake: Select a Kit`` to select a compiler.
    2. The command ``CMake: Select Variant`` to select a the ``Release`` build type.
	  3. The command ``CMake: Build`` to build all targets.
    4. The command ``CMake: Run tests`` to run the tests.
2. You can find the two executables in the ``bin`` directory:
    - ``nonrigid-icp`` is used to estimate the non-rigid transformation between two point clouds.
    - ``nonrigid-icp-transform`` is used to apply the estimated transformation to a point cloud.

### Building on Windows

Look into the [.github/workflows/build-windows.yml](.github/workflows/build-windows.yml) file for instructions on how to build the project on Windows using CMake and Visual Studio.
